                <img class="group_image" src="images/ptera/ptera003.jpg" alt="ptera">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Pteranodon (pteron meaning "wing", anodon meaning "toothless") was the first flier added to
                    EVRIMA in
                    Update
                    #3. It's commonly referred to by the community as "Ptera" for short. Fun fact, Pteranodon was a
                    pterosaur, not a
                    dinosaur. The Pteranodon is a small and fragile animal, and doesn't hold its ground well in combat
                    against
                    anything larger than it. Use the skies to your advantage, and try not to get caught off-guard!</p>

                <h3>Growth Time</h3>
                <p>1 hour</p>

                <h3>Survival Needs</h3>
                <p>The Pteranodon is a piscivore, though can also consume meat. You'll rely on feeding from fresh water
                    sources for
                    fish, though may alternatively choose to hunt juveniles and small animals, if not, then scavenge.
                    Ripples found
                    on the water's surface are indicators for nearby schools of fish, and bodies can be located when
                    using
                    scent
                    (Hold Q), nearby bodies will be highlighted red.

                <h3>Combat Control</h3>
                <p> Hold Spacebar while stationary - Stationary take off.
                    Used to launch yourself into the air to fly.
                    Hold Spacebar while sprinting - Running take off. Costs less stamina than the stationary take
                    off but takes longer to get into the air.
                    Hold Spacebar while flying - Fly upwards.
                    Hold Ctrl while flying - Fly downwards.
                    Hold Shift while flying - Fly faster at an increased stamina cost.
                    Hold Z while flying - Air break. Used to slow yourself down in order to land safely.
                    Hold RMB while flying close to a water source - Skim the water. Perform this action above ripples in
                    water
                    sources to catch fish. Release RMB when prompted to catch a schooling fish.
                    The Pteranodon cannot swallow food while flying.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                The Utahraptor (meaning “utah’s predator”) was the first carnivore added to the EVRIMA update and was
                used to pave
                the future of the game. It’s commonly referred to by the community as “Utah” for short, with occasional
                variations
                in its spelling.

                <h3>Growth Times</h3>
                1 Hour 25 Minutes

                <h3>Survival Needs</h3>
                The Utahraptor is a carnivore. You’ll be relying on your wits to hunt other animals, scavenge for
                bodies, or even
                consider cannibalism. Bodies can be located when using scent (Hold Q), nearby bodies will be highlighted
                red.

                <h3>Combat control</h3>
                Even the most skillful start somewhere, and you’ll be competing against these players so you better get
                acquainted
                with your controls. Find a technique that suits you in combat. Some attacks will drain a high amount of
                stamina with
                a high damage output, so use them wisely.

                prey.
                Successfully pouncing smaller animals pins them to the ground and mauls until you let go. You can only
                latch onto
                larger animals, but be warned: they can buck, draining your stamina.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                Carnotaurus (meaning "meat-eating bull") was the second carnivore added to the game alongside the
                Stegosaurus
                and
                Hypsilophodon.

                <h3>Survival Needs</h3>
                The Carnotaurus is a carnivore. You’ll be relying on your wits to hunt other animals, scavenge for
                bodies, or

                highlighted red.

                <h3>Combat Controls</h3>
                Carnotaurus, though somewhat fragile, is the fastest animal currently added to the game. Don't take his
                fragile
                build for granted, for his ability to push over and stun animals smaller than it is something to fear.
                Use this
                charge to down your enemies and keep them stunned to the ground for a period of time.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                Deinosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodilian related to the modern alligator that lived 82 to 73

                (Ma), during the late Cretaceous period.

                <h3>Survival Needs</h3>
                The Deinosuchus is a carnivore. You are very slow and vulnerable on land but formidable in water. Your
                play-style
                revolves around ambushing dinosaurs using stealth to hide below the waters surface and pull your pray to
                their
                deaths. (Hold Q), nearby bodies will be highlighted red.

                <h3>Combat Control</h3>

                Ctrl in water - Swim downwards.
                Hold RMB when water-walking (walking on the bed of water sources) - Big lunge. Used to grab targets to
                drown them.
                Only effective on targets half your weight or less, otherwise causes you to be staggered.
                Hold RMB on land - Small lunge. As above, but doesn't launch as far and costs more stamina.
                Tap RMB when swimming - Water boost. Used to rapidly launch yourself to your fastest swimming speed.
                Passive - Water Sense. Used for detecting nearby movement in water.
                Hold Q while underwater - Enhanced Water Sense. Used to detect movement in water at a further
                range. The longer the key is held, the further you can sense. In order to use regular scent you must be
                above the

                Hypsilophodon (meaning "Hypsilophus-tooth") is the smallest playable herbivore in-game at this time. The
                small stature of this animal makes dense jungles and fields with tall grass the prime environment for

                Hypsilophodon is a herbivore. You’ll be relying on edible plants to survive. Grazing merely helps stave

                <h3>Combat Controls</h3>
                Hypsilophodon is a speedy critter that sports an impressive jump, but most noteable of all is its
                ability to
                blind predators by spitting out the acidic contents of its stomach onto their face, giving it a chance
