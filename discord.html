                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                <p>Welcome to The Raptors discord. We are a small, but growing community of like minded gamer's who play
                    as
                    carnivores on The Isle. We pack mostly as Utah's on no specific server but our focus is to meet up,
                    grow and
                    then to encourage others to hunt down prey in coordinated teams.
                    Naturally, we are a PVP orientated community but having fun is our main goal. We take combat
                    seriously and
                    believe everyone has something to teach and something to learn. With this in mind we host two
                    training
                    servers both in the EU and US, see our #our-servers for more info.</p>
