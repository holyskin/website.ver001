            <div class="group">
                <p>The Isles beauty and charm is that it features strict non-linear narrative told exclusively through users
                    experiences. Encounters with other players are completely organic and unscripted.
                    Imagine you’re a herbivore grazing with your herd, chatting away with the in-game text chat function; your
                    very typing forces your dinosaur to make roars, rumbles and chirps as you execute lines of text.
                    In the forest ahead a coordinated pack of raptors have been zeroing in on your noisy congregation, they lay
                    hidden in the bushes, unseen, waiting for their opportunity to attack.
                    Then suddenly, without warning they charge out, picking out a young herd member and dispatching it quickly.
                    They drag the body back into the undergrowth to enjoy their kill.
                    You’re not the only thing with sharp teeth though... After claiming your prize, another larger carnivore comes your
                    way, sniffing the scent of the body. Do you stay to defend your kill and risk loosing pack
                    members or do retreat away to find food elsewhere?
                </p>
                <p>A player first starts out selecting whether or not to play a herbivore or a carnivore species and selecting
                    a part of the map to spawn in.
                    Each dinosaur must grow to adulthood. Depending on your choice this could range from 1 hour all the way up
                    to 5.5 hours.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Surviving depends upon feeding and watering your dinosaur. Water is easy to find but is not without its
                    dangers, other players must drink too, some may lie in wait for their chance to turn you into a meal. You
                    must actively hunt your food, following noises and tracks in the ground that other players leave behind. You
                    must be sly and cunning to outwit fellow players in order to turn them into a meal. You will be hunting
                    other players for your right to stay alive.
                    All the while you will be maturing into an adult that ultimately has the best chance of survival. The growth
                    stages look as follows:
                </p>
        
                <p> Hatchling
                    This is the youngest variant you can be; they have no means of fending for themselves. The more appropriate
                    name would be “nestling”, but it’s rarely used.
                </p>
        
                Juvenile
                    Juveniles are older, and more capable than hatchlings and can survive on their own. This word is usually
                    shortened to “Juvie”.
                </p>
                <p>Sub-adult
                    Sub-adults, sometimes called “subs”, are nearly fully grown animals. They are usually faster than their
                    fully counterparts but are smaller and not as strong.
                </p>
        
                <p>Full Grown
                    Full grown animals have reached their peak in terms of the capabilities of their species, and make
                    formidable opponents.
